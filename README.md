# Random-Password-Generator
Did you know that 2/3 of people use the same password across multiple accounts, and 13% of people use the same password for every account? Doing so puts your information in jeopardy. Well, no need to worry - I developed a program with C++ that gives you a secure, randomized password based on your personal preferences. Do you want your password to be completely lowercase? Uppercase? Want numbers in it? It’s all up to you. Often, websites will offer you a secure password, but it’s lengthy, hard to remember, and customizing it takes time.
